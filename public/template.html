    <h2>Check-in</h2>
    <p>
      Please plan to arrive at {{TIME_CHECKIN_BEGINS}} for check-in and be ready
      to compete up to 20 minutes before the
      <a
        href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/{{COMPETITION_ID}}#competition-schedule"

    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <p>
      To help things run smoothly, we split up each round into multiple smaller
      groups. When you arrive, you’ll receive a personalized schedule with
      specifics on which small groups you’ve been assigned to. You’ve also been
      assigned to judge other competitors’ solves for 1 other group for each
      event you’re competing in. We’ll review how this all works at the
      competitor tutorial at {{TIME_OF_COMPETITOR_TUTORIAL}}.
    </p>

    <p>
      We appreciate your cooperation by arriving on-time for all of your
      competing and judging assignments.
